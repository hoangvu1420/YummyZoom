## Brief overview

This set of guidelines outlines the rules for reading project documentation before starting development tasks in the YummyZoom project.

## Documentation reading rules

- Always read the `Docs/YummyZoom_Project_Documentation.md` file to understand the overall structure of the project before starting any task.
- When working with a specific layer, read the corresponding guideline document for that layer in the `Docs/` directory if one exists.
  - For the Domain Layer, read `Docs/Domain_Layer_Guidelines.md`.
  - [Add rules for other layers as documentation files are identified]
