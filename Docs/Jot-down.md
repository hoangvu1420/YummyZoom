In the current tests\Application.FunctionalTests\Features\Orders\PaymentIntegration\OnlineOrderPaymentTests.cs , we have a Setup() method that initializes the test database with required data in order to run the tests. The tests require a valid customer, restaurant, and menu items to create an order. 
This setup method while working, but can be improved into a more structured approach. 
I want to refactor the database preparation code into a separate module in the tests\Application.FunctionalTests test project. This module should handle the creation of necessary entities like customers, restaurants, and menu items, and expose methods to retrieve required data for use in tests like Ids, Name, Prices,... For all tests that require these entities, they can simply call the methods from this module to get the required data.
The performance should also be considered, the test project use real database with test containers, so the setup should be efficient and not take too long to run. Which mean the data seeding should run once and be reused across tests, rather than being recreated for each test run.
Read the documentation in Docs\Development-Guidelines\Application-Functional-Tests-Guidelines.md to understand the overall structure and patterns used in the test project
Analyze the current architecture in the tests\Application.FunctionalTests project and suggest a suitable structure for this new module. The goal is to make the test setup more modular, reusable, and maintainable, while ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with the existing test framework.
