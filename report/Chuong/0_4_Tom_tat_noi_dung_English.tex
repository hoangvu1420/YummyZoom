Group food ordering has become a routine practice among students and office workers, particularly during limited time windows such as lunch breaks. However, despite the convenience of modern food delivery platforms, group ordering remains hampered by a significant pain point: the payment process typically requires one person to pay for the entire order upfront and then collect money from each member afterward. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and creates unnecessary friction outside the app. To address this problem, this thesis presents YummyZoom, a food delivery system developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a key focus on the TeamCart feature. TeamCart allows multiple users to collaboratively add items to a shared cart, receive real-time updates, and most importantly, enables each member to pay for their own portion independently.

From a technical perspective, the project leverages Clean Architecture combined with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to model the business domain and manage the complex collaboration rules within TeamCart. The application layer follows a CQRS pattern to clearly separate read and write operations. The backend is built on .NET 9 and ASP.NET Core, with PostgreSQL serving as the primary data store, Redis providing fast caching, and SignalR handling real-time synchronization. The mobile application is developed using Flutter to ensure a consistent user experience across both iOS and Android platforms. Additionally, the system includes web portals for restaurants and administrators, built with Angular and PrimeNG, to manage menus and monitor orders.

The main contributions of this work include a well-structured, testable software architecture and an effective solution for handling concurrent updates in TeamCart through optimistic concurrency control and real-time synchronization, minimizing conflicts when multiple users interact simultaneously. The resulting system fully supports both individual and group ordering workflows, validated through scenario-based testing and experimental deployment. The thesis also acknowledges several limitations that require future work, including the lack of production-ready payment gateway integration, the absence of a driver management module, missing AI-powered search and recommendation features, and the need for a comprehensive financial management system for restaurants.
