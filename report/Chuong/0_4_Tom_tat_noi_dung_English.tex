Group food ordering is common among students and office workers, but existing platforms have not adequately addressed the payment issue: typically, one person must pay upfront and collect reimbursements from others. This thesis presents \gls{yummyzoom}, a food delivery system at the \gls{mvp} level with \gls{teamcart} as its core feature, enabling multiple users to collaboratively select items, receive real-time updates, and pay for their own portions independently.

The system adopts \gls{cleanarchitecture} combined with \gls{ddd} and \gls{cqrs} to separate business logic, facilitating testing and maintenance. The key contribution is an effective concurrency handling solution through \gls{optimisticconcurrency} and real-time synchronization, minimizing conflicts when members interact simultaneously. The system has been validated through real-world scenarios, supporting both individual and group ordering workflows. Remaining limitations include: payment gateway integration is not production-ready, there is no driver management subsystem, and advanced features such as personalization and restaurant financial modules are not yet implemented.
